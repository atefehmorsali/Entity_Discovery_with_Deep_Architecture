Tackle the problem of entity discovery and recognition across various data modalities with heterogeneous data fusion using deep architecture.  
I used the algorithm described in Heterogeneous Network Embedding via Deep Architectures by Chang et. al (2015), and implement a Deep Learning Architecture that can guess the tags a user might apply to an image, while giving knowledge workers operating on the data insight into how the Flickr images relate to words or concepts (e.g., is this image related to birds, etc).

This was a course project for CSC 591- Algorithms for data guied buisiness intelligence.
